# Sentiment Analysis

In this project I will conduct 3 different approached to implement a sentiment analysis .

## Installation

Requirements: Python and Conda

Create a conda environment with the libraries in the .yml file.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Content
To see the experiments, you should run the notebooks using the kernel created with conda "sentiment-analysis-env"


- PC_01_exp_countvectorizer
         
         This notebooks contains the training, evaluation and predictions of a classification for sentiment analysis using CountVectorizer and tf-idf. 

- PC_02_exp_keras
        
        This notebooks contains the training, evaluation and predictions of a classification for sentiment analysis using keras and embedings. 

- PC_03_exp_BERT
        
        This notebooks contains the training, evaluation and predictions of a classification for sentiment analysis using the pre-trained BERT model.
